The goal of `hotrstuff` is to facilitate the rapid download, wrangling and processing of Earth System Model (ESM) output from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP).

To get started, you will need to download the wget scripts from your chosen CMIP6 repository. We use: <https://aims2.llnl.gov/search>. From there `hotrstuff` makes it easy to:

-   Download,\
-   Merge files,\
-   Regrid to chosen resolution,\
-   Slice to required timeframe,\
-   Crop to requested spatial area,\
-   Create mean/median ensembles of variables, scenarios etc.

## Requirements

`hotrstuff` requires the Climate Data Operators (CDO) software to be installed prior to use. The CDO software is a collection of many operators for standard processing of climate and forecast model data. The operators include simple statistical and arithmetic functions, data selection and subsampling tools, and spatial interpolation. `hotrstuff` leverages the power of CDO, within the `R` environment.

More about CDO installation can be found on the [cdo installer website](https://code.mpimet.mpg.de/projects/cdo/wiki#Installation-and-Supported-Platforms)

#### Mac

The easiest way to install `CDO` is using Homebrew:

```         
brew install cdo
```

More information can be found on the [CDO Mac Website](https://code.mpimet.mpg.de/projects/cdo/wiki/MacOS_Platform).

#### Windows

Recent versions of Windows (\>=10) included an Ubuntu embedded Linux. This environment offers a clean integration with the windows file systems and and the opportunity to install CDO via the native package manager of Ubuntu:

```         
sudo apt-get upgrade
sudo apt-get install cdo
```

More information can be found on the [CDO Windows Website](https://code.mpimet.mpg.de/projects/cdo/wiki/Win32)

#### Unix/Linux

```         
sudo apt-get upgrade
sudo apt-get install cdo
```

## Installation

You can install the development version of hotrstuff from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("SnBuenafe/hotrstuff")
```
